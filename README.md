VOX2FTP
=======

*VOX2FTP is still in development and is not yet ready for prime-time!*

VOX2FTP is a simple utility to monitor a microphone for input, record any input, and upload those recordings to an FTP server.  The program was originally designed to be used as an announcement relay at [MassiveLAN](http://massivelan.com), a for-charity LAN event in Buffalo, NY.  Announcements are captured from the emcee's mic and uploaded to an FTP server for processing and distribution across multiple platforms and channels.

VOX2FTP uses C# (WPF) and the .NET Framework 4.5, leveraging the amazing audio library [NAudio](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio).
